  "description": "I’m a self-motivated and creative Frontend Developer with a background in arts and motion graphic design. This background has given me a strong eye for detail and the ability to think outside the box, transforming me into a creative problem solver who loves to learn by exploring new things and taking on new tasks and technologies. At the same time, my years in tech have really made me value structure and I'm always aiming to write high-quality code. Something I love doing together with colleagues who are just like me, positive, easygoing and curious, who have a “can-do” attitude, strong communication skills and above all, share the same joy of writing really good code.",
